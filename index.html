After breaking down the project into smaller more manageable tasks, I as a Scrum Master, have assigned a task to each member and worked simultaneously using Git branches. We used Classes, Objects, Modules, Functions to give a shape and extra functionalities to the project. We also plugged it onto a server to allow players to have fun in a multiplayer environment. We plan to keep implementing and adding more features to it in the near future. Click on the picture and enjoy the battle! </p> -->

There is a text-box where you can input any command you want to perform within the default story-log, as well as the possibility to create your own story-line to then move in a "own" world designed by you. Either way you choose, the objective of the game is to find a mobile phone to reach out for help and successfully escape, so why don't you click here and have a try?</p> -->

                <h2>Hi everyone, I'm Zack! üëãüèª </h2>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Background - </strong>I am based in London, but I lived in Europe, Asia, and Australia for an extended period of time, where I also worked various jobs and studied. I had a great time ‚Äúdown-under‚Äù: this experience has given me the chance to live independently at such a young age and discover a completely different environment from the one I was used to.</p> 
                <br>
                <p><strong>Tech-focused - </strong>I have a genuine passion for technology, especially when I was abroad I realised how technology links us and how dependent on it we are.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have a knack for problem solving which always keeps me excited to test myself with different challenges or get familiar with new software tools.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During 2020/2021, due to the pandemic, I made the most of the lockdowns and I started to learn how to code, by following online tutorials, and building simple e-commerce websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
                <p>While diving deeper into it, I loved how Software Development was allowing me to unleash my creativity, and shape every product exactly the way I want it to be.</p>
                <p>Besides that, the industry seemed to be in continuous change, many skills to pick up and languages to learn, and with a great potential to play a big role in our tech focused future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To complement my self-learning and further expand my knowledge, I completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp, which helped me build soft skills as well as technical skills such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Typescript, Git, Object-Oriented and Functional Programming.
                On the Bootcamp I had the opportunity to network with likeminded people, and work as part of a team, using Scrum as well as Agile. I took part in various team projects and was able to improve my leaderships skills when I was elected Scrum Master for our final project.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>More about me - </strong>I am open-minded, I love being around people and working as part of a team. I am also coachable, curious, and always keen to learn new things and improve myself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking (I make a terrific lasagna), taking photos or visiting small villages outside London. I am also addicted to music, (81'330 minutes last year on Spotify), and love reading content related to upcoming Tech trends, AI, VR, metaverse and how far technology will take us in the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>- Zack üòÅ -</strong></p>
